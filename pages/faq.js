      <h3>What are the videos?</h3>
      <p>
        The Video Library provides a brief visual introduction to careers,
        career clusters, industries, and related topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Career videos:</strong> There are approximately 520 career
        videos that describe typical work tasks and settings, education
        requirements, and helpful qualities for approximately 1,000 different
        occupations. Some closely related occupations are grouped together so
        that a single video may profile more than one occupation. Each career
        video is approximately 90 seconds in length. Spanish language
        translations are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Career cluster / industry videos:</strong>Career clusters refer
        to groups of occupations with related skills, while industries refer to
        groups of businesses or organizations that share similar activities or
        products. These videos show the relationship of groups of occupations to
        the types of organizations that employ them. There are two videos for
        each of the featured career clusters / industries: the first is an
        overview of the industry's functions, size, and trends, while the second
        video provides a description of occupations available at different
        levels of education and training in that cluster.
      </p>
      <h3>Who created the videos?</h3>
      <p>
        The career videos and career cluster / industry videos were developed by
        CareerOneStop. Career video content is based on data from the U.S.
